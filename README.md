# Top-five-computer-science-and-programming-books

this repository will show you the best five computer science and programming books to learn from based on people rating score 

Libraries used:

The following python libraries were used in this project.

•	Opendatasets
•	Os
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib.pyplot
•	Numpy
•	Seaborn
•	Textwrap
•	warnings

This code runs with python and requires some libraries, to install these libraries you will need to execute:
 
      !pip install opendatasets


Project Motivation:

For this project, I was interested in using Top 270 Computer Science and Programing Books dataset that was taken from Kaggel which holds a list of 270 books about computer science and programming topics constructed using many websites which provide information of book ratings.

1.	What are the top five computer science and programming books to learn from based on rating?
2.	Does the book with the highest reviews the best to learn from?
3.	are books with the highest rating expensive?
